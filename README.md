# Fast-Reading-App
Kivy application for android that helps to read fast > 300 WPM

New skills: web scraping using BeatifulSoup library, text preprocessing.

I was inspiring by startup called Spritz, so i created simple similar version of reader using Kivy library.
This app works with russian site for online reading, you can copy link from this site and add it to app.
Then app will scrap this page and will clean text from html page and will give you this text word by word for reading.
Text prepeared for simple reading by deliting special symbols and converting all letters to lowcase.
You can change speed, navigate throug pages and save your progress.
